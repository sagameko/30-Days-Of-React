/* In this section, there is no note at all, the only thing that needs to be remembered is:

- Use regular for loop anywhere iteration is not know
- do while loop when the number of interation is unknown
- Do while loop and while loop are almost the same but do while loop run at least once even when the condition is false
- for of is used only for array
- forEach is used for array
- for in is used for object

Scope: Variable is the fundamental part in programming. We declaire variable to store different data types. To declare a variable we use the key word var, let and const (now we use let and const more than var). 
A variable can declared at different scope. In this section we will see the scope, scope of variables when we use var or let.
Variables scopes cna be:
 - Window
 - Global
 - Local

 Variable can be declaire globally or locall or window scope.
